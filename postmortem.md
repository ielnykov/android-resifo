## Organisation

The planing of the app, although having had a good start by using Trello, ended up in being
not as thoroughly planed through as thought.
Considering the differences of experience in this field, time was scheduled
to shortly and tasks not distributed equally or based on existing knowledge.
Strengths as well as weaknesses were not taken into consideration enough. Thus,
specifying who is doing what was harder and not thougt out well.

## Development

It was harder than we thougt to complete certain tasks. The design of the layout
took longer than expected because of probles we faced with Android Studio. Using Floobitts in order
to easily work together on one project resulted in being helpful in some points but also
caused problems.
Not working with Scala resulted in having less troubles considering
Android Studio. We chose this option because there is still a lot of information missing about
how Scala is used best with Android Studio.

## Lessons Learned

### ... considering Organisation

Trello is a good tool to split up tasks and to see who is going to do what. Nevertheless, is is important to discuss
who is capable of doing what and to allocate the tasks based on these strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, time is a keynote. Starting to late with
a project results in pressure and in not achieving the desired result.

### ... considering Development

Floobits was helpful considering that everyone was able to work on his own device
on an own file but was also able to change to a file a team member was working on and
to help him out.
Nevertheless, a lack of good organisation can result to more problems in the developement. Bigger tasks, like the google api, should be thought
through in detail beforehand.
Complication should be communicated to the group more often in order for the other team members to know what the problem is and also to what extend
support can be given.
