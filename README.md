### Description

The app "Grazer Meldezettel" aims to create a user-friendly software to help a user to enter all required data for a residence
registration form. In order to do so, the user is required to create an account. This enables him to create new registration
forms, to look them up and to edit and delete already created forms.

### Mock-Ups

The preview of Mock-Ups can be found here:

```./mockups/index.html```


### Prerequisites

In order to run the application properly, following conditions have to be met by your device:

The app is coded for the android version 5.1 "Lollipop" (API Level 22). Thus, running this app with android versions lower
than 5.1 may result into complcations and errors.


### Getting started
In order to run the app on your computer or android device you have to fork our repository from http://github.com/ielnykov/resifo-android .
#### Computer
In order to get the repository, following steps have to be taken;

Start by following this path: **VCS > Checkout from Version Control > Git** . Enter your GitHub credentials and click Login.
Fill out the **Clone Repository** form and click **Clone** .

Following items have to be filled in:

* VCS Respository URL (The URL of your repository on GitHub)
* Parent Directory (The local directory where you want to store the project)
* Directory Name (The name of your project)

When you open the project you will be prompted with a message asking if you would
like to open the project in Android Studio. Answer the question with **Yes** . Then,
the project will open in Android Studio.

The app is now to your free use.

#### Android Device
If you want to run your app on an android device following steps have to be taken:

First of all, the project has to work on your computer. Thus, the only step left is getting
the application from the computer onto your device.

For this purpose, the standard Windows driver for connecting a device is usually not enough. A
dedicated driver for your phone or tablet is needed usually found at the manufacturers website.

The next step is to enable downloading apps that are under development.
This option is called **USB Debugging** and is located at

**Setting/Applications/Development**

When the driver is installed and USB debugging enabled, connect your device to the computer. THe system
will find your device automatically.
If you click the **Run** button now, the device should be visible.
In case that you cannot find your device on the list of options try to restart the program.

Now the app stays on your device even if you disconnect it. Nevertheless,
it can be deleted just as any other app.

### Screenshots

Following tools next to GitHub were used in order to improve the organisation of our project:

##### Trello

![Picture](./src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/trello.png)

Trello was a tool used in order to organize our project better and more efficiently. Tasks are split up easy and you can
see who is going to do what task and what tasks are already done.

##### Floobit

![Picture](./src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/floobit.png)

Floobit is a plugin that enables us to work together on one workspace. It is possible to see what the other
one is doing and to work on your own files to. A team member can easily interact with you and change what you are writing
and everyone has the same files stored in their newest versions on their workspace.

### Releases

Following, the number of releases for this app are listed:

* **02/05/2017 - Version 1.0.0 - First Release**

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Following, frequently asked questions considering the interface of this app will be answered.

##### Do I need to create an account?

Creating an account is necessary to be able to use the app to its fullest extend. Otherwise, the core functionality
won't be available.

Furthermore, creating an account helps us to store all your record forms you created and thus, enables us to provide
you with an overview an the possibility to edit and delete chosen records.

##### I have forgotten my password! What can I do?

If you have forgotten your password you can use our provided **Password Recovery** .
To get there use the provided link **Forgotten password** that can be found at **Sign In** .

##### I have to take a look at a record I made some time ago. Can i find them somewhere?

To find all your previously created records you have to take a look at "Find Record".
There you can search for a specific record you once made as well as choosing one of
your records in the list in order to see an overview of what they consist of as well as to
delete or edit them.

##### How  can I edit an already existing record?

If you want to edit or delete an already existing record, search for your desired record
at "Find Record", choose the record you want and press **Edit**.

You do the same if you want to **delete** a record.

### License

The license used for this project is GPL GNUv3, received from https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/
on the 05.02.2017. For further information please take a look at LICENSE.txt.

##### Why we chose the given license

We chose this licence because we wanted to enable our licensee more than just using the software.We wanted
to enable our licenseemor than ust using the software but to enable him following
rights:

The licensee is allowed to analyse the software by having access to the source
code. This can be done by either providing the source code via a
publicly accessible web server or by handing over a CD or DVD that holds the
code.

Furthermore, the licensee has the right to distribute the software without being charged fees by the licensor.
The basic idea was that the licensee is allowed to profit of our application by being able to modify the software according tohis or her expectations or that the licensee
is able to implement parts of our code in their own software.

Although w want to provide these possibilites for the user of this app at the moment,
we appreciate the possibility to hide our code in order to safe intellectual property.
### Contributors
